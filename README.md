# pyexe.exe

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/n18f0997k18x87lw/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/manthey/pyexe/branch/master)

I have often wanted a stand-alone version of python that would be a single Windows executable.  This is my attempt to make a generally useful executable.

It consists of the most recent versions of  Python 2.7, pywin32, and psutil, and includes all packages that py2exe sensibly includes without extra work.

See the appveyor script for build instructions.

Go ahead and use the executable or source as you see fit.  Credit is appreciated, but not necessary.  I accept no liability.  

If you found this useful, let me know.  Please file any issues.  Obviously, one could include more or less libraries to either add features or reduce the size of the executable.  I don't intend to make alternate versions with different libraries.
